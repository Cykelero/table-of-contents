# Table of contents

<b>Table of contents</b> is a Safari extension for quickly navigating documents, available for macOS and iOS.

In any web page with sections (an article, a documentation page, etc), summon Table of contents to see a list of all headings in the page. Click any to jump to it instantly.

On macOS, the list supports click-and-drag selection, arrow key navigation, and type-to-select. You can also invoke the list by pressing ⌃G.
